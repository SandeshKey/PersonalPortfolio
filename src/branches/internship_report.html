                My internship at ‘Rangin Technology’ was one of the most fruitful and delightful
                period throughout my academic career. During my internship program, I got to learn
                plethora of new things each day. I got to see, work and understand with things which I had
                only studied theoretically before. The ambience of our office was peaceful and aesthetic
                where we could work all day without any sort of issues. I got to learn how technologies
                are being used in real world, and also received an opportunity to work on it. I learnt a lot
                of working principles, procedures and other key components in project development life
                cycle. Apart from that, I also learnt about time management as well as improving other
                hard and soft skills. I also got opportunities to work in real-time flutter projects where I
                collaborated with senior developers, designed mobile interfaces and solved application
                problems related to mobile applications. I also learned about Application Programming
                Interface (API), which is one of the most useful software intermediary for communication
                between applications. <br> <br>
                Through my internship, I acquired a variety of competencies such as proficiency in
                Figma and Github, an understanding of design thinking and user-centered design
                principles, and experience with mobile app development using Flutter. I also learned the
                importance of effective communication and collaboration with team members, as well as
                the value of receiving and implementing feedback. Overall, my internship at Rangin
                Technology was a valuable learning experience that provided me with practical skills and
                knowledge to pursue a career in UI/UX and mobile app development. All-inclusive,
                working with senior software developers in Rangin taught me a lot of new things which
                will definitely help me in coming future.
