                This work entails a thorough exploration of the System Development Life Cycle (SDLC) for Mantra Car
                Rental Company, culminating in the selection and implementation of the Rapid Application Development
                (RAD) methodology. The project is divided into two parts, with the first encompassing the initial stages
                of SDLC, from project initiation and planning to system analysis and design. Emphasis is placed on agile
                methodologies, iterative development, and requirements gathering, presenting a robust foundation for
                subsequent implementation. <br><br>
                Part two delves into the detailed construction, testing, and deployment phases, elucidating the choice
                of specific programming languages and tools for web development, database management, and interface
                design. The testing phase is meticulously outlined, encompassing unit testing, integration testing, and
                system testing, crucial for ensuring the reliability and efficiency of the developed system. The
                deployment phase discusses the selected changeover strategy to minimize disruptions during the
                transition. <br><br>
                Central to this work is the adoption of RAD, a dynamic methodology tailored to swiftly deliver a
                high-quality system. The RAD model's four distinct phases, ranging from requirements planning to
                cut-over, are analyzed in the context of Mantra Car Rental's unique requirements. Visual aids such as
                diagrams and Gantt charts enhance the understanding of the proposed system.

            The Mantra Rental Company has been offering car rental services for the last 2 decades. The
            The company offers car rentals of various models, which is further stated by its manufacturers, name
            of the model, daily rental costs, registration number, and odometer reading as well.

            <br> <br>
            Currently, there are two genuine options available to book a car from Mantra Rental Company:
            company visit and phone call booking. A client has to pay a visit to the rental company to check the
            appearance and operational quality of desired cars. Likewise, if a client wants to book a
            car via phone call, the company will provide a handful of basic information about the inquired
            cars. To finalize the booking of a car, information of clients such as their name, address, mobile
            numbers, driver's license, and also the odometer of the car is recorded in Microsoft Excel
            Spreadsheet. A few of the crucial stuff used during this business process are given below : <br><br>

                As mentioned before, possible ways of renting cars from Mantra Rental Company are company
                visits and phone booking. However, with the technology advancing and people probing for easy
                alternatives, these available options seemed insufficient. To book a car physically (eye to eye),
                clients need to visit the company during office hours (i.e., between 10 AM and 5 PM). The
                company also provided feedback to make office hours more flexible. On the other hand,
                information provided via audio couldn’t satisfy customers to hire cars. Customers seem hesitant
                to confirm the booking of cars without actually watching how they look and operate. With the new
                system, customers can study every detail of cars and reserve it without any hurdles. The new
                online system also allows clients to book cars from anywhere and at any time. This means, there
                is no more worrying about reaching the company within limited hours to book a car. <br><br>
                Likewise, pointing to the database system being used currently, the company is storing data using
                Microsoft Spreadsheet, which according to Forbes(Leung, 2014) contains about 90% of the fallacy.
                Furthermore, this also consumes plenty of time as staff need to scroll in and out of spreadsheets,
                to find old records. With the new system, errors in the database can be plummeted and details of
                old customers will be automatically shown when their ID number or name is entered.

                Agile methodology is software development approach, based on the concept of iterative
                and incremental imitation of software development. Instigated against the background of
                laboriously regulated models, the methodology concentrates on team participation and
                satisfactory result. Continual cooperation with stakeholders and welcoming improvements at any
                phase is what makes this approach different to traditional methodologies (McCormick, 2012).

                The agile methodology is based on the Agile Manifesto and comprises 4 values and 12
                principles. Propositions behind this manifesto are what it requires, to attain project agility.
                With the implementation of appropriate principles in the correct project situation, the project
                becomes more agile. The project can be directed in development rather than documentation.
                Furthermore, flexibility and superiority in product quality can be achieved with agility. From
                frequent customer feedback to mutual understanding between working parties, the agile

                Creating software consumes a lot of time as well as effort. However, that time and effort are not
                worth it unless clients are satisfied with the product they receive. Therefore, the principle behind

                For the software creation in Mantra Rental Company, delivering working software regularly in
                between short intervals would make the project flexible and engaging. Firstly, stakeholders should
                not wait long until the product is entirely built. Secondly, with continuous delivery, end users get
                accustomed to the product operation, and hence, with appropriate feedback, a satisfactory result is
                expected.

                also prospers faith, support, satisfaction, and self-empowerment between team members. <br><br>

                everything done during the project is considered a failure: both by clients and the project team.

                The waterfall model is the first introduced model among all the process models. It is also
                recognized as a linear–sequential life cycle model, which means that it demonstrates the process
                of software development in linear–sequential flow. This is the methodology where there is no
                phase reverse i.e., returning to the previous phase in between the project development is not
                feasible. This is a traditional method that avoids the involvement of users in between development
                processes. This model is mostly used for projects involved with software engineering.

                There are various modeling techniques under RAD methodology but we would like to adopt
                business, process, and data modeling techniques. Business process modeling is represented by a use
                case and activity diagram which shows the flow of information between various business
                channels. Similarly, the data modeling technique is represented by ERD or class diagram which
                helps to identify the data sets and shows the relationship between those data. These diagrams are
                also called conceptual or logical design. <br> <br>
                The diagrams that represent all three modeling techniques are described below:

                In the case of our system, the ‘Car Rental System’ is represented by a rectangular shape. Similarly, two
                actors are the customer and the employee. Since the actors are external objects, they are placed
                outside the rectangular shape. Here the customer is the primary actor whereas the employee is a
                secondary
                actor who is going to act after the primary actor does something on the system. So, according to
                the rules, the customer is placed on the left side and the employee on the right side of the system.
                Moreover, the tasks that can be performed by each actor are connected using a connector. Also,
                two types of customers are connected to the customer actor using the generalization
                arrow. Similarly, the functions or operations that customers and employees can access are bounded
                by an oval shape inside the rectangular shape.

                The above figure is the class diagram of Mantra Car Rental Company where class is denoted
                by a rectangular shape with three partitions. Class names, attributes, and methods are placed at the
                top,
                middle, and bottom portions respectively. Similarly, classes are connected by an arrow called
                association and dependencies are shown using aggregation and composition. In addition to this,
                inheritance is shown by generalization sign. <br> <br>
                From the case study provided, the classes of the car rental system are customer, employee,
                payment, car, and booking. Two types of customers are general and corporate customers
                which are inherited to the customer class. So, they are connected with the customer class using
                A generalization sign. The same thing is applied to payment. Similarly, the composition symbol is used
                between the customer and payment because to make a booking customer needs to make payment
                compulsorily.

                The activity diagram is used to demonstrate the flow of control of the activity within the system.
                This diagram describes the dynamic behavior of the system. The main purpose of drawing this
                The diagram is to make the client understand their system in more detail.So, the above diagram shows how
                the messages flow from one activity to another.So, the activities that can be performed by the users are
                represented by rounded rectangles.

                Interface design is the graphical layout of the system. Good interface design helps users to easily
                interact with the system. So, designing user interfaces is an important part of the system development
                life cycle. Even RAD methodology also mainly focuses on designing UI rather than planning and
                requirement analysis. So, we have also designed the User Interface of the car rental system and
                delivered it to the customer repeatedly to gather feedback and refine the interface designs
                according to the feedback provided to us. So, the final user interface design of ‘Mantra Car

                Unfamiliarity with the system might cause issues for end users. So, to make users familiar with the new
                The system, we have to plan about implementing the parallel running system change over strategy.
                Despite being expensive, as the old system needs to be operated alongside the new system for a certain
                period thinking that the data are more important than cost, the company also agreed with
                our idea. So, this method can be best suited for the deployment of the car rental system. In
                addition to this, the changeover will be the best option in terms of data integrity as well. Besides
                this, if
                the new system gets failure, the old system can be reverted which helps to give continuity to the work
                without any obstruction.

                RAD (Rapid Application Development) is a software development methodology, designed for
                high-standard systems along and swift development. Derived from rapid prototyping
                approximation, the chief objective of this methodology is to provide an upgraded level of the system

                centralized more on tasks and user involvement but less on detailed planning and analysis. It is
                a form of Agile methodology that gives precedence to iterations. The development phases of this
                methodology are also gathered as concise, iterative evolution patterns as the iterative approach
                emphasizes productivity and flexibility to correction (Kaur & Verma, 2014).

                functionalities (Kikama Jr, 2010). A required number of meetings are conducted between
                administration and Information System (IS) management with the motive of reaching
                cooperation and initiating the development process. If necessary, end users and IS

                For Mantra Car Rental Company, this is their introductory step in software systems and digital
                marketing. So, when meetings for requirement planning are conducted, there are high odds that
                clients or executives fail to recall every requirement. In another case, they might even
                come up with new concepts to make some distinctive alterations to the system. In these sorts of
                conditions, modifications are required. Unlike traditional methodologies, the RAD model
                focuses on iteration which emphasizes redoing a certain task unless customers are satisfied
                with the result. In the case of CRC, using the RAD model will allow clients and the project team to make
                necessary changes at any time so that the company can stay ambitious following its objectives.

                During the construction phase, the RAD model is considered to be trustworthy while transforming
                user design into functional software. The reusable code in the RAD model lessens manual coding
                and space for bugs. The use of prototypes and less risky methods allows users and developers to
                have a close look at the project and avoid obstructions within the CRC system. Moreover,
                with RAD, the CRC system can be built by focusing on functionalities rather than taking
                excessive risks by adding unnecessary complex features.

                Once the construction phase is done, the CRC system is in the final stage where the system is installed
                and closing tests will be done. Since the development period is significantly reduced,
                The delivery time between iteration and prototype is also minimized. The early integration from the
                project’s foundation can assist developers in recognizing bugs easily (Softermii, 2021). Early
                deliveries are provided to clients so that they can continue their business and find complications
                within the system. With the RAD model, investors and users who will be operating the system in
                CRC will be asked for feedback so that necessary iterations can be done to enhance the
                software.
