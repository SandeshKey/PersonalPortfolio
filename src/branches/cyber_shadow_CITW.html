                With the swift enlargement of technology and means, especially in the computational universe, immense
                convenience and comfort have been experienced by users. However, the process includes not only total
                relief but also plenty of drawbacks and a term, ’Computer Crime’. In general, computer crime is a deed
                of invading one’s exclusive data for distinctive multiple purposes (i.e., financial loss, reputation
                harm, unbalancing organizations, terror acts, and many more). Identity theft, identity fraud, and
                phishing are also computer crimes that have been creating devastating riddles for consumers in this
                advanced period. These computer crimes are inevitable as knowledgeable handlers create new and diverse
                methods (from alluring users towards some interesting or tempting advertisements to making them drop at
                least a tiny bit of information about themselves). These faults can occur in one or two ways, but
                hackers or crackers have hundreds of possible paths for conducting these activities. With the inclusion
                of some captivating real-life incidents and advice from victimized people and computer experts, this
                case exploration assists in defending personal information in every possible way. Furthermore,
                encouragement to everyone must be given so that vigorous step is taken to minimize these crimes and
                clients can operate devices safely and eradicate negative thoughts about computers and their
                applications.

                Identity theft refers to the loss or mishandling of any particular data. It is illustrated as an
                unauthorized utilization of someone else’s exclusive data to impersonate or commend cheating. Identity
                theft has been a progressively growing problem, not only in some exceptional places but universally. The
                fabrication of new mechanisms for conducting actions like stealing or any illegal purpose by hackers and
                crackers has failed to eradicate challenges for consumers. The foremost information that the exploration
                provides is that being careless, even on very inferior information about any individual or an
                organization, can guide that respective user to their identity insecurity. Consequently, a client should
                be pretty intelligent and fully prepared to guard his data from every obstacle at any particular time.

                There are numerous and diverse types of identity theft. Some of them are:

            <br>

            <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-duration="1000" data-aos-easing="linear"
            class="leading-relaxed md:leading-loose">
                Identity theft has been exhibiting devastating outcomes for billions of users around different corners
                of the world. Reports from ‘ABC News claim that citizens of the United States squander about 25 billion
                USD every year and are still in ascending order. Moreover, how enthusiastic is it to know that 1 in
                every 16 people is a victim of identity theft in the present situation? A new consumer is introduced to
                this field every 2 seconds, and more than 100 people have already been victimized when we are reading
                this sentence. <br> <br>
                Even very minor information (that is, name, address, date of birth, or medical records) can also be used
                to mishandle anyone’s identity. A real-life example of a bus boy named Abraham Abdullah can be studied,
                who used web-enabled mobile phones and virtual voice mail services to access phone calls and messages.
                The busboy accustomed himself to the statistics of more than 200 celebrities, and it was alleged that he
                used the basic information of those people from library books and social media. Decisively, he was
                arrested in 2001 and sanctioned according to the law. <br><br>
                Given the positive behavior that motivates them, a client should positively motivate themselves and get
                ready to overcome every blunder. What this evaluation counsels is that identity theft is almost
                inevitable for every person, but there are more or less solutions to deal with it. It is a very clear
                message from this analysis that no personal information should be shared on any unlicensed sites or
                pages. Likewise, every operator should use strong and updated passwords and firewalls to keep the
                documents safe. It is also essential to check and control periodical data regularly.

                As per the former learning, ‘Identity Theft’ means losing or getting personal or organizational
                information mishandled. Correspondingly, ‘Identity Fraud’ concerns the misuse of those stolen materials
                to commit actual evil actions or to accomplish aid or welfare. This illegitimate act has been creating
                some of the most catastrophic consequences in the computing sector in this contemporary period.

                Since this can be deceived by any user, every consumer must be inclined to defend his data and
                statistics in every possible way. This can be pretty hazardous, as fraudsters can access client
                documents for law-breaking activities but leave the original location so that the actual owner of the
                data will be responsible.

            <ul data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-duration="1000" data-aos-easing="linear" style="list-style-type: disc;">

                The act of identity fraud has been creating detrimental and negative impressions about computing and its
                application to operators' intellects. Deceivers or tricksters can employ private information for various
                distinctive reasons, like creating fake bank and exclusive accounts, applying for passports, selling
                identities, or misdeeds related to currency or terrorism. Credit card fraud is one of the most familiar
                examples of identity fraud, where a fake user will purchase goods unjustifiably or create fake criminal
                records. <br><br>
                A real-life example of US citizen Jack can be examined to be more clear about this case. Jack was a
                severe victim of identity fraud, where his bank account was misused to buy a car worth $80,000 and an
                apartment with all utilities. He encountered thousands of difficulties because of that and got past that
                case, luckily. Currently, he advises every client to monitor credits and practice on authorized
                websites. <br><br>
                Furthermore, the case of Dora from Italy seems to be both an appealing and a scary example of identity
                fraud, where tricksters misapplied her wallet and personal information within it. What happened later
                was a nightmare when they established illegal business companies and hampered her medical reports. This
                not only took her about 3 years to prove herself innocent but also made her a patient of mental illness.
                <br><br>
                Any rational handler should use protection techniques and stay ahead of crackers using multiple
                distinctive modes. Because identity fraud can occur at any time, a consumer should be aware of
                unsolicited calls or emails. Moreover, one should be concerned about sharing any of their data only with
                licensed websites or webpages. <br>

                Phishing primarily relates to scams. This is the activity where an attacker steals or tends to steal
                client data using diverse modes. Hackers or crackers disguise themselves as faithful and ethical beings,
                especially in online communication. This has been creating indirect impressions among computing
                operators that it’s unsafe to perform any sort of activity on the internet. <br> <br>
                Fraudsters or phishing experts have usually skillfully trained themselves and investigated any
                particular person’s data to fool them in easier or more relevant ways. From the financial loss of any
                individual to the possibility of getting a virus implanted in an organization’s device, phishing can
                guide anyone to severe loss.

                An instance an incident at one of the essential universities in Toronto can be taken as an example of
                phishing. What happened was that fraudsters cracked the data of the professor at that university through
                an advertisement and got access to his information. But what happened afterward was more scary, as those
                crackers sent emails to plenty of students through the professor's email and made them log into fake
                websites. This victimized them mischievously, as they lost pretty much all of their welfare and, more
                importantly, their medical and personal data. <br><br>
                Phishing might be a never-ending trouble, especially for online communicators, but every consumer should

                phone calls to using third-party software (e.g., SysCloud), a device and one’s stats or data can be kept
