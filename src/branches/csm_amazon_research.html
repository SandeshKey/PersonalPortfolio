                Amazon.com, Inc. is currently the world’s largest online retailer. Initiated as an
                online marketplace for books back in 1994, the company has over 300 million active
                users using its services in various ways. Understanding the mounting revolution of the
                web, Jeff Bezos and Co. successfully turned an online bookseller into ‘The Everything
                Store’ owning a large number of subsidiaries. The company provides its service in more
                than 185 countries and has a revenue of 469.8 billion USD (Wikipedia contributors,
                2022). Competing with giant companies like Alibaba Group, Netflix Inc., and Apple Inc.,
                the company has over forty subsidiaries including IMDb, Goodreads, Amazon Web
                Services, and many more. </p>

                SWOT stands for Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats, which is an
                analysis framework to impartially examine and evaluate overall company performance
                from four different points of view. The SWOT analysis evaluates both internal as well
                external factors along with the company’s current conditions and anticipated future
                events. Each four components of SWOT is unique and helps to analyze a company
                distinctively. ‘Strengths’ in SWOT depict what makes a company stand out from its
                competitors and what it outshines others at. ‘Weaknesses’ grasp areas where a company is
                unable to achieve its objectives at its supreme level. ‘Opportunities’ alludes to advantages
                that a company can take advantage of, to come out on top of their competitors. Lastly,
                ‘Threats’ are elements that can negatively affect a company.

                To avoid product failures, Amazon can create unique products focusing on a
                specific market to stand out from their competitors. However, this must be done with an
                appropriate study of customer demands and market regulations as well.

                Amazon services such as AWS claim that users can control their data safely and to
                the fullest. However, there is always a risk of data leaks because someone could release
                the data by mistake or even intentionally (Hamel, 2017).

                To overcome these sorts of issues, Amazon must encrypt its data at the highest

                Firstly, Amazon’s supply chain refers to the process using which Amazon operates
                everything from product storing to product delivery. In this process, the company makes
                maximum use of Information Technology to diversify reach, build financial gain, and
                increase the company’s productivity.

                Understanding Amazon’s supply chain strategies, we can see that there are two
                key elements: Amazon warehouses and Amazon’s delivery. The company can make use
                of numerous robotics and automated technologies in these departments to enhance
                efficiency and decrease warehouse costs as well. Since Amazon has already introduced
                the web and other technical services, the company can also make appropriate use of
                technology by manufacturing digital products and selling them at lower prices
                themselves.

                The figure above depicts a drone that Amazon plans to use for product deliveries.
                If planned and utilized correctly, the drone service can be a game changer for Amazon. It
                clearly shows how technology can make things feasible and simplify the supply chain. It can work as a
                supply chain enabler for the company and helps to maintain operation and
                worker costs as well.
