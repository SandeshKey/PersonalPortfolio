                The study experimentally investigated how a website is designed and brought to operate, with The
                utilization of HTML, CSS, and Javascript. The academic website gives an account of how audiences and end
                users benefit from its use. The motive of the project is to furnish obligatory provision of information,
                graphics, and events. Evaluation processes and procedures encompass a detailed study of all required
                particulars. More or less of the attributes are equipped and currently, unavailable prerequisites are
                planned for future enhancement.

                hired my team to develop a website for them.

                Before further enhancing your project you need to set certain objectives of your project so that it
                gives a path to achieve the goal that you have set. So, there are certain objectives for developing this

                Before developing a website we need to identify the problems with existing sites. This helps you to
                identify what you need to include in your website, which helps you to achieve the objectives. Some
                of the problems that have been faced by the organization in the absence of the organization’s website
                are as follows:
                <br><br>

                Considering all the complications within the organization, lack of marketing and customer
                interactions were some serious issues. Therefore, the organization hired us to seek solutions to their
                problems. So, we have developed the website in such a way that it overcomes all the problems.

            However, our team faced multiple technical difficulties during the project. Compatibility in
            browsers was lacking which at first, was solved after following the rules of makeup
            validation. Likewise, our team also faced internet-related issues as the connection was too
            weak to check web page loading. The use of too many rich media and images increased the size
            of webpages which slowed down the speed of webpage loading. This was solved by
            minimizing the sizes of used files.

                This is one of the most commonly used languages. This was first introduced in 1991 by Tim Berners-
                Lee ( V.Arya, R.Yankee,2020). This was upgraded from time to time. The last time it was upgraded was in

                from XHTML to HTML5(V.Arya, R.Yankee,2020). Various tags and elements are used to display

                <li> <b>Inline CSS: </b>
                    This is the type of CSS that can be written inside the HTML code. It is easy to write. It is written
                    without using the selector.
                    But in inline
                    styles, if you want to change the color of all the text inside the h1 tag to blue then you need
                    to style
                    every h1 text which is one of the disadvantages of inline styles. This type of styling of
                    HTML is not used often. <br> <br>

                <li><b>External CSS</b>
                    This is a type of CSS that needs a separate CSS file. To style the text in html code we need to
                    introduce a class or id inside the html tags so that using this class and id we can style the text.
                    This style is done externally as we need to open separate files to follow this type of style. <br>

                <li><b>Internal or Embedded CSS</b>
                    This type of styling is performed in the head section of the HTML code. So, this type of styling
                    does
                    not need any kind of link or file extension to save the CSS code as it is written inside the HTML
                    code. <br> <br>

                Recently, javascript is most popular programming language as it is easy to understand . This
                language was first introduce in 1995 by Brendan Eich. As there is another programming language
                called java , although name of this two programming language looks similar but they are vast
                different to each other. Java script also be simply written in any text editor used to develop
                webpages. We can learn java script through W3C school which is one of the most popular sites to
                learn programming language. Similar to that of html and css there are various tags in java script
                which we need to know about. Simply javascript is written inside closing and opening script tag. As html
                is used to give structure and css is used to give style to
                webpage, java scrip is used to make webpage interactive. Javascript is used to create application for
                mobile , develop games, add interactive behaviour to web pages, build server and develop server
                application(R. Hack, 2018).
