                Our project, the "Malaysian Urban Banking Management System," represents a revolution
                in modern banking. This assignment explores the dynamic world of banking technology,
                where computers have reshaped the landscape. This console-based banking application is
                designed to offer essential services to both clients and administrators. Its primary goal is
                to provide user-friendly, secure, and attractive banking experiences. <br> <br>
                Admins play a crucial role, in managing clients and overseeing operations. Registration
                and login are prerequisites for admin access, ensuring security. The project employs C
                programming concepts, including structures, arrays, functions, loops, validation, file
                handling, and pointers. These concepts are woven into the application's fabric, creating a
                robust and efficient banking system. In a nutshell, the project showcases a sample output,
                demonstrating its real-world functionality. It represents the power of technology in
                modern banking, delivering a secure and user-friendly platform for all.

                Banking applications represent a category of enterprise software extensively adopted by
                banking institutions and held in high regard by their clientele. The contemporary appeal of
                these applications can be attributed to their characteristics of simplicity, security, visual
                appeal, and the added incentive of exclusive offers provided through the application
                platform. <br><br>
                Regarding the specific project at hand, it involves the development of a banking
                application derived from the Malaysian Urban Bank Management System. This software
                application primarily focuses on delivering an array of services related to client accounts
                within the banking sector. The software operates within a console-based environment,
                distinguishing between two key user roles: 'Admin,' responsible for system operation, and
                'Clients,' who benefit from the provided services.

                There are two major user types in our application: Admin and Clients. Both of them have
                their own sets of privileges which they can use to facilitate the banking process. Their
                major roles and functions and roles are described below:

                class="leading-relaxed md:leading-loose">
                In a broader context, an administrator assumes the responsibility of overseeing, managing,
                and facilitating client interactions within the application framework. This role
                encompasses several distinct functions aimed at effectively handling and supporting
                clients. Administrators are empowered to access and review the client database, display
                transaction records, and execute account deletions when necessary. To engage in
                administrative activities within this software environment, registration, and authentication
                are integral prerequisites.

                In a parallel vein, clients represent end-users who avail themselves of the application's
                services. Their roles encompass accessing and utilizing the features provided by the
                system. Clients are granted specific privileges that enable them to interact with their
                accounts. These include accessing exclusive account information, updating personal
                details, monitoring account balances, executing financial transactions such as deposits and
                withdrawals, and reviewing transaction histories. To participate as clients in this software
                ecosystem, they must undergo a registration and login process, thereby ensuring secure
                access to their designated functionalities.
