                Virtual Learning Environment, also known as VLE, is an online platform designed to amplify
                students’ learning experience. It is a technique of teaching and learning with the assistance of
                electronic means, internet and other available online tools. <br><br>
                The COVID-19 pandemic is a disease outbreak caused by a newly discovered coronavirus. The
                disease is widespread across many countries and causing critical illness among the people. WHO
                (World Health Organization) declared this virus as an outbreak in January 2020 and eventually a
                pandemic just after 2 months in March, 2020 (WHO, 2020).

                To overcome this complication, the concept of Virtual Learning Environment came into effect.
                Schools, universities and other educational institutions reinitiated teaching, focusing on remote
                learning approaches. With virtual learning, education became possible despite the global pandemic: not
                physically but virtually. Top online platforms like Udemy, Codecedamy and
                Skillshare are started adding more free courses so that students can get access to courses they
                like to learn. Meanwhile teamwork hubs like Microsoft Teams, Zoom and Google Meet provided
                free services for students once they verify themselves. With virtual learning environment,
                learning process got pliable as well as more innovational (aswathynandan, 2015).

                What’s more, Virtual Learning Environment has some further consequential elements, fruitful for
                both learners and institutions. More than just a communication between tutors and students, VLE
                platforms provides important features such as :

                Moreover, platforms like Microsoft Teams and Zoom provides features like creating a classroom
                environment on web applications, with the help of internet. This allows teachers to teach students
                as if everyone is in the classroom, connected to each other. Every student can ask their questions
                or discuss about topics just like in physical classrooms. Notes uploaded by teacher can be
                accessed by students anytime and anywhere for their usage.

                The COVID-19 pandemic shut down the whole world and virtual learning ended up becoming a

                modern technologies of learning i.e., VLE (Virtual Learning Environment). Virtual learning
                became something really important for learners. Some of the advantages of virtual learning from

                That said, Virtual Learning Environment also have some challenges and hurdles. Firstly, virtual
                learning is one of the ways to limit children’s social interaction, which ultimately affects the
                creativity of a learner. Since there is no face to face communication, a student can neglect his
                social and emotional expertise, being surrounded by virtual environment. (Teacher Education
                Advancement Network Journal (TEAN)). <br> <br>
                Secondly, lack of proper preparation can be evidently seen in students allied to virtual learning.
                Students will face obstacles in solving real life challenges that are present beyond the computer
                screen. Moreover, the concept of virtual learning is still not practiced properly in most of the
                countries. Not only tutors lose control over the students and classroom, but there is also no
                proper control over learning atmosphere (Taylor Francis Online, 2016).

                E-learning method has both positive as well as negative impact in student’s life. Merits and
                drawbacks depend upon users and their methods or usage. <br><br>
                Firstly, the use of a virtual learning environment helped us to learn our course easily without any
                doubt because this learning system provides us with video recording facilities which we can
                access anytime and watch repeatedly. Throughout the pandemic, we felt that we had forgotten
                our schedule that we used to follow before the pandemic. Now, this learning system has helped
                us to improve our schedule and focus on our study more curiously. <br><br>
                Moreover, a mentor can guide us with our problems one by one any instantly via virtual learning
                platforms. While we were using it and taking lessons of a specific course, we were able to
                discuss our problem using features available in the application. This helps teachers to guide and
                discuss chapters among all active students.. Also, this facility helped students to get rid of
                shyness and made everyone able to express themselves virtually be it asking any issues that we
                felt or presenting our assignments (aswathynandan, 2015). <br><br>
                On the other hand, the tech field of study also experienced few negative impacts too. Majority of
                the students were not able to attend any classes due to lack of internet facilities as they could not
                connect to virtual classrooms, especially in rural areas. So, this somehow hampered the mentality
                of some students and even faded their interest. The minimized curiosity of students became
                problematic and mental pressure without any productive work became a new issue. In brief, this
                system raised the bar of laziness by some extent and distracted students from doing their task.
                Most of the students might not feel good taking classes online rather they prefer to visit physical
                classes. In our field, as students were not made compulsory to open their video camera while attending
                classes, students felt being away from teachers and that for sure, hamper in their
                concentration towards the teacher. Meanwhile, students could be busy using mobile phones or
                even do some other work like sleeping or playing games, rather than studying. Taking all these in
                consideration, virtual learning environments cannot be declared completely advantageous in our
                field of study (Ghimire, 2020). <br> <br>

                VLE has distinctive methods of learning. Selection of appropriate learning method can be handy
                in learning effectively. The learning activities take place either entirely or partially online. They
                can be conducted by means of electronic media without the use of the Internet. Organization
                needs to design their delivery structure to meet the requirement of majority of students or its
                user. General Learning Management System (LMS), Virtual classroom, Gamification Learning
                Management system (GLMS) are some main methods for delivering virtual learning
                environment (Bozkurt, 2020).

                resources like, Zoom, Teams, Skype, Google Meet. By the help of these kinds of channels,
                students are given knowledge, ability to communicate and practice with their teacher. This type
                of online platforms fulfill the needs of physical class to some extent (Dhawan, 2020).

                Although, there are some good reasons to use a virtual learning environment in pandemic
                but in case of using personally, I think there are some positive as well as negative impact that it
                creates throughout study in pandemic. <br> <br>

                were able to discuss our problem using raising hand emoji. This may help teachers to guide and
                discuss with all active students, teachers can teach their students one by one. Also, this facility
                helped us to get rid of our shyness and made us able to ask any issues that we felt while studying
                without any fear ( Wang&Cheng, 2020). <br> <br>
                On the other hand, there are some few negative impacts too that can be felt while using it.

                management system or any other digital tool out of nowhere without additional training. So, this might
                have minimized the curiosity of students toward study. Similarly, this system might have
                increased the laziness and also distracted the schedule of the student. Most of the students might
                not feel good taking classes online rather they prefer to visit physical classes. Since, students
                need not to open their cam while attending classes they might be less concentrated towards the
                teacher while they might be busy using mobile or prefer to sleep. Besides these problems there
                are other problems too . So, a virtual learning environment might not be advantageous to all the
                students (Ghanour & Ezzat ,2020).
