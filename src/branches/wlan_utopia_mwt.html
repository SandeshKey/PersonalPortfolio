                The prime objective of this project is to deploy a wireless LAN (Local Area
                Network) in a SOHO ambiance. As a network consultant, the goal is to administer an appropriate
                resolution for an IT company named Utopia Tech. Utopia is a SO(Small Office), established
                to provide gratifying assistance to clients utilizing advanced & innovative
                technology in every possible way. This report about WLAN infrastructure design incorporates
                details about the site survey, utilization of site survey tools, designs, justifications, and
                consideration
                of hardware, software, and other ample information. Likewise, the project further comprises
                security requirements during the WLAN deployment along with crucial features like reliability,
                scalability, and easily maintainable for future use. Scant obstacles during the process are carefully
                taken care of and appropriate actions are taken to avoid them from the deployment

                Internet, also known as ‘Net’ is a globally connected wide area network system that permits
                users to communicate and access the required data from anywhere around the globe. The Internet,
                being so powerful, draws people within it for some kind of interaction. From logging on to a
                social newsfeed to being updated or with expectations of sociability, the internet is an indispensable
                part
                of one’s life (Porter, 1997). All these connections are provided in multiple forms which also
                includes Wireless Network. Wireless network is further broadly divided into four major types:
                Wireless PAN, Wireless LAN, Wireless MAN, and Wireless WAN.

                WLAN, also known as Wireless Local Area Network is a wireless communication that
                uses high-frequency infrared radio waves, to establish connections between devices or to
                convey data from one point to another, without wired cables. The foremost aim is to deploy a
                wireless LAN on the premises of Utopia Tech. This is to ensure that staff and visitants can access
                strong internet communication along with the required software. So, the site survey is conducted

                To acquire the required information, a physical survey of the site territory is conducted.
                This is called a site survey. A standard wireless device with testing tools is used to examine
                coverage, propagation and factual performance of WLAN network(ZVANOVEC et al.,2003).
                Moreover, site survey conduction helps spot interference which further intercepts,

                determines the passive survey to be the most economical one as it requires little manpower and is easy
                to conduct among all three types. Predictive surveys can be commanding when there are

                Out of all three types of site surveys (Passive Survey, Active Survey, and Predictive Survey),
                the chosen type is Active Site Survey. This is because an active survey provides precise statistics

                much an unrealistic task, not just because of physical obstructions, but also because of natural
                factors. There are generally two Line of Sight (LoS): Visual and Radio. Visual LoS refers that a
                transmitter visualizing the receiver while Radio LoS refers to the transmission of radio signals

                The performance of the selected wireless standard (IEEE 802.11ac) is disrupted by other

                (Bluetooth), it distorts the performance of IEEE 802.11ac through the FHSS hops. While

                surrounds half of the 2.5 GHz band. This creates a collision among the networks, which ultimately
                plunges the performance of IEEE 802.11ac. Other than proximity or Bluetooth devices, there are
                other sources of interference such as Microwave oven interference, Radio signals interference,
                Cordless phone interference and so on (Cisco Press, 2015). <br> <br>

                Since most of the ethernet cables are made up of copper and they use electrical signals for
                data transmission, the possibility of electromagnetic interference occurs rises significantly. To
                prevent this, ‘shielded cables’ are used to cushion the wire from any sort of interference
                or electromagnetic leakages. Ethernet cables are further categorized as ‘Cat’ versions along with
                their distinctive specifications. Apart from ethernet cables, selection of fiber optic cables is also
                considered for the side. Basic differences between these cables are demonstrated in the table below:

                special. However, considering the fragile nature of Fiber Optic cables, the recommendation is to
                choose Ethernet cables: either Cat 7a or Cat 8. However, the talk about cables can be done with

                An Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is a security software that diminishes security threats

                harm the system by accessing it in an unauthorized way. The main reason to install an Intrusion
                Detection System in a system is because it alerts system administrator in case of any suspicious
                activities, by monitoring network traffic of the environment. The IDS is further classified into
                two major types: Host Intrusion Detection Software (HIDS) and Network Intrusion Detection

                methods, and procedures of Wireless Local Area Network setup. The site survey conducted
                during the WLAN deployment produced several learning opportunities and few complications to
                solve. Likewise, the project also created a chance to learn about network hardware and software
                in depth. In a nutshell, wireless LAN is deployed in an SOHO environment and the internet can be
                accessed as well. External RF interferences were detected and necessary actions were taken to
                troubleshoot them and facilitate the best possible internet coverage.
